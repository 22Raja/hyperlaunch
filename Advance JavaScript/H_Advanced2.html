<!-- var is function scope, and let and const are block scope
var can be duplicated but let cannot be declared more than once.
Default is var keyword for variable declaration.

What is Hoisting?

JavaScript moves declarations (var, function) to the top.

Variables: Hoisted but initialized as undefined.

Functions: Fully hoisted (can be called before declaration).

"Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) with let & const"::

Variables declared with let/const are hoisted but not initialized.

Accessing them before declaration throws ReferenceError.
