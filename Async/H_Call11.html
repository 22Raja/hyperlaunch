/*
 Using Promise.any: 
Promise.any is useful when you want to run 
multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and 
only need one of them to succeed. It resolves as 
soon as any of the promises is fulfilled, ignoring 
the rest. If all the promises fail, it rejects with an 
AggregateError. 
Example: Video Upload with Multiple Servers 
Let's say we have multiple video servers, and we 
want to upload the video to whichever server 
responds the fastest: 
*/

// Simulate video upload to multiple servers with promise 
function uploadToServer(serverName) 
{ 
return new Promise((resolve,reject) => { 
const uploadTime = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3000) +1000; // Random delay between 1-4seconds 
console.log(`Uploading to ${serverName}...`); 
setTimeout(() => { 
if (uploadTime < 2500) { //Simulating success for fasteruploads 
console.log(`Video uploaded successfully to ${serverName}`); 
resolve(`Success: ${serverName}`); 
} 
else 
{ 
console.log(`Failed to upload to ${serverName}`); 
reject(`Error: ${serverName}`); 
} 
}, uploadTime); 
}); 
} 

// Using Promise.any to upload to multiple servers and pick the fastest one 
Promise.any([uploadToServer("Server 1"), uploadToServer("Server 2"), uploadToServer("Server 3")]) 
.then((result) => { 
console.log("Uploaded video to the fastest server:", result); 
// Notify user about successful upload 
}) 
.catch((error) => { 
console.error("All servers failed to upload:", error.errors); 
});
 
/*
Promise.any takes an array of promises 
and resolves as soon as the first promise is 
fulfilled. 
If all promises are rejected (e.g., all servers 
fail), it throws an AggregateError 
containing details of all the rejected promises.
*/

/*
Summary: 
 
Use Promise.all when you want to wait 
for all operations to complete successfully 
before proceeding. 
 
Use Promise.any when you want to 
proceed as soon as any one of the operations 
completes successfully, ignoring failures in 
others.
