/*
Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) are JavaScript functions that are executed immediately after
 they are defined. 
They are typically used to create a local scope for variables to prevent them from polluting the global scope.

Syntax:

(function (){ 
// Function Logic Here. 
})();
*/

/*
IIFEs are commonly used to create private scope in JavaScript, allowing variables and functions to be encapsulated and 
inaccessible from outside the function.

It is also known as a self-executing anonymous function. 
*/

/*
IIFE's are used to define and execute functions on fly and use them on the spot without extra line of Code.
A normal function simply includes a declaration and a definition but
 an IIFE is declaration, definition and invocation at the same time
