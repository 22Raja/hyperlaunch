/*
1. Using Promise.all: 
Promise.all is used when you want to run 
multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and 
wait for all of them to complete. If any of the 
promises fail (i.e., get rejected), the entire 
Promise.all will be rejected. 
Example: Uploading Multiple Videos 
Suppose we want to upload multiple videos 
simultaneously and only proceed when all videos 
are successfully uploaded: 
*/

// Simulate video upload with promise 
function uploadVideo(videoName) { 
return new Promise((resolve, 
reject) => { 
console.log(`Uploading ${videoName}...`); 
setTimeout(() => { 
console.log(`${videoName} uploaded`); 
resolve(videoName); 
}, 2000); 
}); 
} 

// Using Promise.all to upload multiple videos in parallel 

Promise.all([uploadVideo("Video1"), uploadVideo("Video 2"),uploadVideo("Video 3")]) 

.then((results) => { 
console.log("All videos uploaded:", results); 
console.log("Publishing videos..."); 
// Now, publish the videos or notify the user 
}) 
.catch((error) => { 
console.error("An error occurred while uploading videos:", error); 
}); 

/*
Promise.all takes an array of promises and resolves when all of them are completed. 

If any of the uploads fail, the catch block will be triggered, and it wonâ€™t proceed further.
