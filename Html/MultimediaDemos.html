<!--
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. 
If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the 
browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers 
that do not support the <video> element.

Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted):
File Format	Media Type
MP4		video/mp4
WebM		video/webm
Ogg		video/ogg

Only MP4, WebM, and Ogg video are supported by the HTML standard.

<!-- The YouTube URL in src must have and use the embed endpoint instead of watch, so for instance 
let s say you want to embed this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6N9782MzFQ (browser's URL).

You should use the embed endpoint, so the URL now should be something like https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6N9782MzFQ. 
Use this value as the URL in the src attribute inside the iframe tag in your HTML code

Add mute=1 after autoplay=1 to let your video start playing automatically (but muted).
