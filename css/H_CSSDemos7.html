<!--Here are the states you can change link color for with CSS:

a:hover – when the mouse pointer hovers over it.
a:active – when a user clicks the link.
a:visited – visited link.

By default, links have underlines. To remove underline from link with CSS, use the CSS text decoration property.

It has four possible values: underline, overline, line-through, and none.
-->
<style>
/*
