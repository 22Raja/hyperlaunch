JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.

JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.

JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.

There are following features of JavaScript:

--All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
--JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
--JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
--JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
--It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
--It is a case-sensitive language.
--JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
--It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.


JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:

--****************************Client-side validation,
--Dynamic drop-down menus,
--Displaying date and time,
--Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
--Displaying clocks etc.

3 Places to put JavaScript code:::

--Between the body tag of html
--Between the head tag of html
--In .js file (external javaScript)

When an HTML document is loaded into a browser window, then it becomes a ""document object"". The document object stores the elements of an HTML document, such as HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags as objects.

//window object is the default object in javascript
alert("hello");
window.alert("bye");//window object!!!
alert("34"==34);
alert(10*"55");
alert(1==true);
alert(1=="true");//false
